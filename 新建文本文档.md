TIME PASS BY

When learning
not hard at all
but really get interesting on frontend coding
bought my first server computer
write some interesting node server suck as
bilibili-forward-api

To join AGV
I didn't mean to join AGV, but lucky my info is interested by CTO of this company.
Then I develop a project about echarts by vue3 and go to interview without cv, just take with my pc and show my work.
quite scared that time, study in BaoAn library till night, and I'm quite quite happy when I success

First job at AGV
did work about big screen visibility, migrate old projects from vue2 to vue3
stupid and nervous, but get quite confident then.
know a little js and css,
just beginning to learn ts pinia, a little knowledge about vue3 and vue-router, a little knowledge about vite config such as resolve.alias and server.proxy, a little knowledge about debounce and throttle.
try to use axios, element-plus ui, echarts, git and git lab
try to work with backend
try to build myself component and npm package
try to use websocket and canvas, which helped me find another better work
don't understand too many things, don't know solutions to many many problems

To join ZMO
develop and deploy a small project about painting on canvas
learn react redux react-router antd and build a todo-list, it's interface is very beautiful I think.
Really not good experience that time because the delay of entry.
But still, quite happy when I get it.
